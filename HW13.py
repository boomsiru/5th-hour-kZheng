#1. Create a list containing 10 integers of your choice.
NumberList = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
#2. Create two empty variables named evenNumbers and oddNumbers.
evenNumbers = ""
oddNumbers = ""
#3. Make a loop that counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list.
#(HINT: The way to see if a number is even is if it is divisible by 2).
k = 0
for NumberList in range(0, 10):
    if NumberList % 2 ==0:
        k +=1
    else:
        k +=1
print(k)





# Print the total count of even and odd numbers.
